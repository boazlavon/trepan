### ⚠️ Licensing and Modifications Notice

This codebase is originally licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3).  
The version included in the [EG-CFG](https://github.com/boazlavon/eg_cfg) project contains modifications made by the EG-CFG Research Team at Tel Aviv University.

The purpose of these changes is to support real-time extraction of **canonicalized execution traces** during program inference.  
These traces capture structured runtime signals (variable values, function calls, bytecode-level steps) to guide large language models in generating code, as described in Section 3 of the EG-CFG paper.
