difications to Trepan / TrepanXPy / X-Python
----------------------------------------------

This submodule includes changes made as part of the EG-CFG project:
Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance for Code Generation.

The modifications allow the debugger to emit canonicalized execution traces —
a structured format that captures runtime behavior such as variable values,
function calls, and bytecode instructions.

These traces are used to guide large language models during generation.
